About the text
-------------------

The <em>Tao Te Ching</em> is a great literary work of the Chou dynasty attributed to Lao Tzu. The text evokes the meaning of the <em>Tao</em>&mdash;often translated as "the way," "the darkness," or "the essence"&mdash;through its fluidity and discrete passages.

This version is another translation that focuses on the user's interaction with its structure.
