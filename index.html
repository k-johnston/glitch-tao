          The Tao Te Ching is a great literary work from the Chou dynasty
          attributed to Lao Tzu. The text evokes the meaning of the Tao through its fluidity and
          discrete passages, which can be read asynchronously.

        <p>
          The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Tao.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name that can be named is not the enduring and unchanging name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conceived of as having no name, it is the Originator of heaven and
          earth; conceived of as having a name, it is the Mother of all things.
        </p>
        <p class="poetry">Always without desire we must be found,</p>
        <p class="poetry">If its deep mystery we would sound;</p>
        <p class="poetry">But if desire always within us be,</p>
        <p class="poetry">Its outer fringe is all that we shall see.</p>
        <p>
          Under these two aspects, it is really the same; but as development
          takes place, it receives the different names. Together we call them
          the Mystery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where the Mystery is the deepest is the gate of all that is subtle and
          wonderful.

        <p>
          All in the world know the beauty of the beautiful, and in doing this
          they have the idea of what ugliness is; they all know the skill of the
          skillful, and in doing this they have the idea of what the want of
          skill is.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it is that existence and non-existence give birth the one to the
          idea of the other; that difficulty and ease produce the one the idea
          of the other; that length and shortness fashion out the one the figure
          of the other; that the ideas of height and lowness arise from the
          contrast of the one with the other; that the musical notes and tones
          become harmonious through the relation of one with another; and that
          being before and behind give the idea of one following another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore the sage manages affairs without doing anything, and conveys
          his instructions without the use of speech.
        </p>
        <p>
          All things spring up, and there is not one which declines to show
          itself; they grow, and there is no claim made for their ownership;
          they go through their processes, and there is no expectation of a
          reward for the results. The work is accomplished, and there is no
          resting in it as an achievement.
        </p>
        <p class="poetry">The work is done, but how no one can see;</p>

        <p>
          Not to value and employ men of superior ability is the way to keep the
          people from rivalry among themselves; not to prize articles which are
          difficult to procure is the way to keep them from becoming thieves;
          not to show them what is likely to excite their desires is the way to
          keep their minds from disorder.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore the sage, in the exercise of his government, empties their
          minds, fills their bellies, weakens their wills, and strengthens their
          bones.

        <p>
          He constantly tries to keep them without knowledge and without desire,
          and where there are those who have knowledge, to keep them from
          presuming to act on it. When there is this abstinence from action,
          good order is universal.

          The Tao is like the emptiness of a vessel; and in our employment of it
          we must be on our guard against all fulness. How deep and unfathomable
          it is, as if it were the Honored Ancestor of all things!
        </p>
        <p>
          We should blunt our sharp points, and unravel the complications of
          things; we should attemper our brightness, and bring ourselves into
          agreement with the obscurity of others.
        </p>
        <p>How pure and still the Tao is, as if it would ever so continue!</p>

          Heaven and earth do not act from the impulse of any wish to be
          benevolent; they deal with all things as the dogs of grass are dealt

          Heaven is long-enduring and earth continues long. The reason why
          heaven and earth are able to endure and continue thus long is because
          they do not live of, or for, themselves. This is how they are able to
          continue and endure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore the sage puts his own person last, and yet it is found in
          the foremost place; he treats his person as if it were foreign to him,
          and yet that person is preserved. Is it not because he has no personal
          and private ends, that therefore such ends are realized?

          The highest excellence is like that of water. The excellence of water
          appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without
          striving to the contrary, the low place which all men dislike. Hence
          its way is near to that of the Tao.
        </p>
        <p>
          The excellence of a residence is in the suitability of the place; that
          of the mind is in abysmal stillness; that of associations is in their
          being with the virtuous; that of government is in its securing good
          order; that of the conduct of affairs is in its ability; and that of
          the initiation of any movement is in its timeliness.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when one with the highest excellence does not wrangle about his
          low position, no one finds fault with him.

          It is better to leave a vessel unfilled, than to attempt to carry it
          when it is full. If you keep feeling a point that has been sharpened,
          the point cannot long preserve its sharpness.

          When gold and jade fill the hall, their possessor cannot keep them
          safe. When wealth and honors lead to arrogancy, this brings its evil
          on itself. When the work is done, and one&rsquo;s name is becoming
          distinguished, to withdraw into obscurity is the way of Heaven.

          When the intelligent and animal souls are held together in one
          embrace, they can be kept from separating. When one gives undivided
          attention to the vital breath, and brings it to the utmost degree of
          pliancy, he can become as a tender babe. When he has cleansed away the
          most mysterious sights of his imagination, he can become without a
          flaw.
        </p>
        <p>
          In loving the people and ruling the state, cannot he proceed without
          any purpose of action? In the opening and shutting of his gates of
          heaven, cannot he do so as a female bird? While his intelligence
          reaches in every direction, cannot he appear to be without knowledge?
        </p>
        <p>
          The Tao produces all things and nourishes them; it produces them and
          does not claim them as its own; it does all, and yet does not boast of
          it; it presides over all, and yet does not control them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is what is called &ldquo;The mysterious Quality&rdquo; of the

          The thirty spokes unite in the one nave; but it is on the empty space
          for the axle, that the use of the wheel depends. Clay is fashioned
          into vessels; but it is on their empty hollowness, that their use
          depends. The door and windows are cut out from the walls to form an
          apartment; but it is on the empty space within, that its use depends.
          Therefore, what has a positive existence serves for profitable
          adaptation, and what has not that for actual usefulness.

          Therefore the sage seeks to satisfy the craving of the belly, and not

          Favor and disgrace would seem equally to be feared; honor and great
          calamity, to be regarded as personal conditions of the same kind.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is meant by speaking thus of favor and disgrace? Disgrace is
          being in a low position after the enjoyment of favor. The getting that
          favor leads to the apprehension of losing it, and the losing it leads
          to the fear of still greater calamity:&mdash;this is what is meant by
          saying that favor and disgrace would seem equally to be feared.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what is meant by saying that honor and great calamity are to be
          similarly regarded as personal conditions? What makes me liable to
          great calamity is my having the body which I call myself; if I had not
          the body, what great calamity could come to me?

          Therefore he who would administer the kingdom, honoring it as he

          entrusted with it.

          We look at it, and we do not see it, and we name it &ldquo;the
          Equable.&rdquo; We listen to it, and we do not hear it, and we name it
          &ldquo;the Inaudible.&rdquo; We try to grasp it, and do not get hold
          of it, and we name it &ldquo;the Subtle.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          With these three qualities, it cannot be made the subject of

          Its upper part is not bright, and its lower part is not obscure.
          Ceaseless in its action, it yet cannot be named, and then it again

          We meet it and do not see its Front; we follow it, and do not see its

          The skillful masters of the Tao in old times, with a subtle and
          exquisite penetration, comprehended its mysteries, and were deep also
          so as to elude men&rsquo;s knowledge. As they were thus beyond
          men&rsquo;s knowledge, I will make an effort to describe of what sort
          they appeared to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shrinking looked they like those who wade through a stream in winter;
          irresolute like those who are afraid of all around them; grave like a
          guest in awe of his host; evanescent like ice that is melting away;
          unpretentious like wood that has not been fashioned into anything;
          vacant like a valley, and dull like muddy water.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who can make the muddy water clear? Let it be still, and it will
          gradually become clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who can secure the condition of rest? Let movement go on, and the
          condition of rest will gradually arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          They who preserve this method of the Tao do not wish to be full of
          themselves. It is through their not being full of themselves that they
          can afford to seem worn and not appear new and complete.
        </p>

      <section id="tao16">
        <h2>Chapter 16</h2>
        <p>
          The state of vacancy should be brought to the utmost degree, and that
          of stillness guarded with unwearying vigor. All things alike go
          through their processes of activity, and then we see them return to
          their original state.
        </p>
        <p>
          When things in the vegetable world have displayed their luxuriant
          growth, we see each of them return to its root. This returning to
          their root is what we call the state of stillness; and that stillness
          may be called a reporting that they have fulfilled their appointed
          end.
        </p>
        <p>
          The report of that fulfilment is the regular, unchanging rule. To know
          that unchanging rule is to be intelligent; not to know it leads to
          wild movements and evil issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          The knowledge of that unchanging rule produces a grand capacity and
          forbearance, and that capacity and forbearance lead to a community of
          feeling with all things.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this community of feeling comes a kingliness of character; and he
          who is king-like goes on to be heaven-like. In that likeness to heaven
          he possesses the Tao. Possessed of the Tao, he endures long; and to
          the end of his bodily life, is exempt from all danger of decay.

          In the highest antiquity, the people did not know that there were

          How irresolute did those earliest rulers appear, showing by their
          reticence the importance which they set upon their words! Their work

          The partial becomes complete; the crooked, straight; the empty, full;

          Therefore the sage holds in his embrace the one thing of humility, and
          manifests it to all the world. He is free from self-display, and
          therefore he shines; from self-assertion, and therefore he is
          distinguished; from self-boasting, and therefore his merit is
          acknowledged; from self-complacency, and therefore he acquires
          superiority.

        <p>
          It is because he is thus free from striving that therefore no one in

          The skillful traveller leaves no traces of his wheels or footsteps;

          The Tao in its regular course does nothing for the sake of doing it,
          and so there is nothing which it does not do.
        </p>
        <p>
          If princes and kings were able to maintain it, all things would of
          themselves be transformed by them.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this transformation became to me an object of desire, I would
          express the desire by the nameless simplicity.
        </p>
        <p class="poetry">Simplicity without a name</p>
        <p class="poetry">Is free from all external aim.</p>
        <p class="poetry">With no desire, at rest and still,</p>
        <p class="poetry">All things go right as of their will.</p>

          Those who possessed in highest degree the attributes of the Tao did
          not seek to show them, and therefore they possessed them in fullest
          measure. Those who possessed in a lower degree those attributes sought
          how not to lose them, and therefore they did not possess them in
          fullest measure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who possessed in the highest degree those attributes did nothing
          with a purpose, and had no need to do anything. Those who possessed
          them in a lower degree were always doing, and had need to be so doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who possessed the highest benevolence were always seeking to
          carry it out, and had no need to be doing so. Those who possessed the
          highest righteousness were always seeking to carry it out, and had
          need to be so doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who possessed the highest sense of propriety were always seeking
          to show it, and when men did not respond to it, they bared the arm and
          marched up to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it was that when the Tao was lost, its attributes appeared; when
          its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared; when benevolence was
          lost, righteousness appeared; and when righteousness was lost, the
          proprieties appeared.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now propriety is the attenuated form of leal-heartedness and good
          faith, and is also the commencement of disorder; swift apprehension is
          only a flower of the Tao, and is the beginning of stupidity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it is that the Great man abides by what is solid, and eschews
          what is flimsy; dwells with the fruit and not with the flower. It is
          thus that he puts away the one and makes choice of the other.

          The things which from of old have got the One the Tao are&mdash;
        </p>
        <p class="poetry">Heaven which by it is bright and pure;</p>
        <p class="poetry">Earth rendered thereby firm and sure;</p>
        <p class="poetry">Spirits with powers by it supplied;</p>
        <p class="poetry">Valleys kept full throughout their void</p>
        <p class="poetry">All creatures which through it do live</p>
        <p class="poetry">Princes and kings who from it get</p>
        <p class="poetry">The model which to all they give.</p>
        <p>All these are the results of the One Tao.</p>
        <p class="poetry">
          If heaven were not thus pure, it soon would rend;
        </p>
        <p class="poetry">
          If earth were not thus sure, &rsquo;twould break and bend;
        </p>
        <p class="poetry">Without these powers, the spirits soon would fail;</p>
        <p class="poetry">
          If not so filled, the drought would parch each vale;
        </p>
        <p class="poetry">Without that life, creatures would pass away;</p>
        <p class="poetry">Princes and kings, without that moral sway,</p>
        <p class="poetry">However grand and high, would all decay.</p>
        <p>
          Thus it is that dignity finds its firm root in its previous meanness,
          and what is lofty finds its stability in the lowness from which it
          rises. Hence princes and kings call themselves &ldquo;Orphans,&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Men of small virtue,&rdquo; and as &ldquo;Carriages without a
          nave.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          Is not this an acknowledgment that in their considering themselves
          mean they see the foundation of their dignity?
        </p>
        <p>
          So it is that in the enumeration of the different parts of a carriage
          we do not come on what makes it answer the ends of a carriage. They do
          not wish to show themselves elegant-looking as jade, but prefer to be
          coarse-looking as an ordinary stone.

          Scholars of the highest class, when they hear about the Tao, earnestly
          carry it into practice. Scholars of the middle class, when they have
          heard about it, seem now to keep it and now to lose it. Scholars of
          the lowest class, when they have heard about it, laugh greatly at it.

        <p class="poetry">Loud is its sound, but never word it said;</p>
        <p class="poetry">A semblance great, the shadow of a shade.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
          The Tao is hidden, and has no name; but it is the Tao which is
          skillful at imparting to all things what they need and making them
          complete.

          The Tao produced One; One produced Two; Two produced Three; Three
          produced All things. All things leave behind them the Obscurity out of
          which they have come, and go forward to embrace the Brightness into
          which they have emerged, while they are harmonized by the Breath of
          Vacancy.
        </p>
        <p>
          What men dislike is to be orphans, to have little virtue, to be as
          carriages without naves; and yet these are the designations which
          kings and princes use for themselves.

          All things are produced by the Tao, and nourished by its outflowing

          This honoring of the Tao and exalting of its operation is not the

          A state may be ruled by measures of correction; weapons of war may be
          used with crafty dexterity; but the kingdom is made one&rsquo;s own
          only by freedom from action and purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          How do I know that it is so? By these facts:
        </p>
        <p>
          In the kingdom the multiplication of prohibitive enactments increases
          the poverty of the people; the more implements to add to their profit
          that the people have, the greater disorder is there in the state and
          clan; the more acts of crafty dexterity that men possess, the more do
          strange contrivances appear; the more display there is of legislation,
          the more thieves and robbers there are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore a sage has said, &ldquo;I will do nothing of purpose, and
          the people will be transformed of themselves; I will be fond of
          keeping still, and the people will of themselves become correct. I
          will take no trouble about it, and the people will of themselves
          become rich; I will manifest no ambition, and the people will of
          themselves attain to the primitive simplicity.&rdquo;

          Shall we then dispense with correction? The method of correction shall

          Therefore the sage is like a square which cuts no one with its angles;

          For regulating the human in our constitution and rendering the proper
          service to the heavenly, there is nothing like moderation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is only by this moderation that there is effected an early return
          to man&rsquo;s normal state. That early return is what I call the
          repeated accumulation of the attributes of the Tao. With that repeated
          accumulation of those attributes, there comes the subjugation of every
          obstacle to such return. Of this subjugation we know not what shall be
          the limit; and when one knows not what the limit shall be, he may be
          the ruler of a state.
        </p>
        <p>
          He who possesses the mother of the state may continue long. His case
          is like that of the plant of which we say that its roots are deep and
          its flower stalks firm:&mdash;this is the way to secure that its

          Let the kingdom be governed according to the Tao, and the manes of the
          departed will not manifest their spiritual energy. It is not that
          those manes have not that spiritual energy, but it will not be
          employed to hurt men. It is not that it could not hurt men, but
          neither does the ruling sage hurt them.

          When these two do not injuriously affect each other, their good

          What makes a great state is its being like a low-lying, down-flowing
          stream;&mdash;it becomes the centre to which tend all the small states
          under heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          To illustrate from the case of all females:&mdash;the female always
          overcomes the male by her stillness. Stillness may be considered a
          sort of abasement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it is that a great state, by condescending to small states, gains
          them for itself; and that small states, by abasing themselves to a
          great state, win it over to them. In the one case the abasement leads
          to gaining adherents, in the other case to procuring favor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The great state only wishes to unite men together and nourish them; a
          small state only wishes to be received by, and to serve, the other.
          Each gets what it desires, but the great state must learn to abase
          itself.

          might present on his knees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why was it that the ancients prized this Tao so much? Was it not
          because it could be got by seeking for it, and the guilty could escape
          from the stain of their guilt by it? This is the reason why all under
          heaven consider it the most valuable thing.

          It is the way of the Tao to act without thinking of acting; to conduct
          affairs without feeling the trouble of them; to taste without
          discerning any flavor; to consider what is small as great, and a few
          as many; and to recompense injury with kindness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The master of it anticipates things that are difficult while they are
          easy, and does things that would become great while they are small.
          All difficult things in the world are sure to arise from a previous
          state in which they were easy, and all great things from one in which
          they were small.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore the sage, while he never does what is great, is able on that
          account to accomplish the greatest things.
        </p>
        <p>
          He who lightly promises is sure to keep but little faith; he who is
          continually thinking things easy is sure to find them difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore the sage sees difficulty even in what seems easy, and so
          never has any difficulties.

          That which is at rest is easily kept hold of; before a thing has given
          indications of its presence, it is easy to take measures against it;
          that which is brittle is easily broken; that which is very small is
          easily dispersed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Action should be taken before a thing has made its appearance; order
          should be secured before disorder has begun.

        <p>
          The tree which fills the arms grew from the tiniest sprout; the tower

          thousand li commenced with a single step.
        </p>
        <p>
          He who acts with an ulterior purpose does harm; he who takes hold of a
          thing in the same way loses his hold. The sage does not act so, and
          therefore does no harm; he does not lay hold so, and therefore does
          not lose his bold.
        </p>
        <p>
          But people in their conduct of affairs are constantly ruining them
          when they are on the eve of success. If they were careful at the end,
          as they should be at the beginning, they would not so ruin them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore the sage desires what other men do not desire, and does not
          prize things difficult to get; he learns what other men do not learn,
          and turns back to what the multitude of men have passed by. Thus he
          helps the natural development of all things, and does not dare to act
          with an ulterior purpose of his own.

          The difficulty in governing the people arises from their having much

        </p>

          He who knows these two things finds in them also his model and rule.
          Ability to know this model and rule constitutes what we call the
          mysterious excellence of a governor. Deep and far-reaching is such
          mysterious excellence, showing indeed its possessor as opposite to

          So it is that the sage ruler, wishing to be above men, puts himself by
          his words below them, and, wishing to be before them, places his
          person behind them.

          The people do not fear death; to what purpose is it to try to frighten
          them with death? If the people were always in awe of death, and I
          could always seize those who do wrong, and put them to death, who
          would dare to do wrong?
        </p>
        <p>
          There is always One who presides over the infliction death. He who
          would inflict death in the room of him who so presides over it may be
          described as hewing wood instead of a great carpenter. Seldom is it
          that he who undertakes the hewing, instead of the great carpenter,
          does not cut his own hands!

          The people suffer from famine because of the multitude of taxes
          consumed by their superiors. It is through this that they suffer
          famine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The people are difficult to govern because of the excessive agency of
          their superiors in governing them. It is through this that they are
          difficult to govern.
        </p>
        <p>
          The people make light of dying because of the greatness of their
          labors in seeking for the means of living. It is this which makes them
          think light of dying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it is that to leave the subject of living altogether out of view
          is better than to set a high value on it.

        <p>
          Man at his birth is supple and weak; at his death, firm and strong. So
          it is with all things. Trees and plants, in their early growth, are
          soft and brittle; at their death, dry and withered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it is that firmness and strength are the concomitants of death;
          softness and weakness, the concomitants of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence he who relies on the strength of his forces does not conquer;
          and a tree which is strong will fill the out-stretched arms, and
          thereby invites the feller.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore the place of what is firm and strong is below, and that of
          what is soft and weak is above.

        <p>
          May not the Way or Tao of Heaven be compared to the method of bending
          a bow? The part of the bow which was high is brought low, and what was
          low is raised up. So Heaven diminishes where there is superabundance,
          and supplements where there is deficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the Way of Heaven to diminish superabundance, and to supplement
          deficiency. It is not so with the way of man. He takes away from those
          who have not enough to add to his own superabundance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who can take his own superabundance and therewith serve all under
          heaven? Only he who is in possession of the Tao!
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore the ruling sage acts without claiming the results as his; he
          achieves his merit and does not rest arrogantly in it:&mdash;he does
          not wish to display his superiority.

          There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet
          for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that
          can take precedence of it;&mdash;for there is nothing so effectual for
          which it can be changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every one in the world knows that the soft overcomes the hard, and the
          weak the strong, but no one is able to carry it out in practice.

        <p class="poetry">Therefore a sage has said,</p>

        <p class="poetry">To him who bears men&rsquo;s direful woes</p>
        <p class="poetry">They all the name of King accord.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Words that are strictly true seem to be paradoxical.</p>

          When a reconciliation is effected between two parties after a great
          animosity, there is sure to be a grudge remaining in the mind of the
          one who was wrong. And how can this be beneficial to the other?
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore to guard against this, the sage keeps the left-hand portion
          of the record of the engagement, and does not insist on the speedy
          fulfilment of it by the other party. So, he who has the attributes of
          the Tao regards only the conditions of the engagement, while he who
          has not those attributes regards only the conditions favorable to
          himself.

          In the Way of Heaven, there is no partiality of love; it is always on

          In a little state with a small population, I would so order it, that,
          though there were individuals with the abilities of ten or a hundred
          men, there should be no employment of them; I would make the people,
          while looking on death as a grievous thing, yet not remove elsewhere
          to avoid it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though they had boats and carriages, they should have no occasion to
          ride in them; though they had buff coats and sharp weapons, they
          should have no occasion to don or use them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would make the people return to the use of knotted cords instead of
          the written characters.
        </p>
        <p>
          They should think their coarse food sweet; their plain clothes
          beautiful; their poor dwellings places of rest; and their common
          simple ways sources of enjoyment.
        </p>
        <p>
          There should be a neighboring state within sight, and the voices of
          the fowls and dogs should be heard all the way from it to us, but I
          would make the people to old age, even to death, not have any
          intercourse with it.

          Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere. Those who are
          skilled in the Tao do not dispute about it; the disputatious are not
          skilled in it. Those who know the Tao are not extensively learned; the
          extensively learned do not know it.

          The sage does not accumulate for himself. The more that he expends for
          others, the more does he possess of his own; the more that he gives to
          others, the more does he have himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          With all the sharpness of the Way of Heaven, it injures not; with all
          the doing in the way of the sage he does not strive.
